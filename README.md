Hello there, I am  Dr Sakina
I am a curious, innovative healthcare data analyst. I strive to set new standards and drive innovation in healthcare data analytics. This portfolio is the beginning of my journey to show who I am and to demonstrate my potential in reaching my goals. 

This folder has projects that contain various clinical data analyses.
Every folder in this repository has all relevant files that contain code, pictures, and a raw dashboard link to Power BI.

Project 1. **Hospital Readmission Analysis**

Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a key quality metric, reflecting patient outcomes, care coordination, and chronic disease management. Diabetes patients are particularly at risk due to complex treatment regimens and comorbidities.

Project 2. **Risk Stratification for Patients with Chronic Diseases**
This project aims to identify patients at low, medium, or high risk of developing health complications based on demographics, lifestyle factors, and clinical indicators. By stratifying risk, healthcare teams can prioritize interventions, prevent adverse outcomes, and optimize care resources, which is essential in a value-based care environment.

Project 3. **Hospital Appointment No-Show Analysis**
This project analyzes a real-world hospital appointment dataset (110,514 records) to identify the **primary drivers of no-show behavior** and translate those insights into **actionable operational strategies**.

The goal is not only to understand *who* misses appointments, but *why* — and more importantly, **what the hospital can do about it**.
