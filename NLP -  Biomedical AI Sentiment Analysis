In this project, we built a sentiment analysis pipeline for biomedical AI-related text. The pipeline includes data cleaning, TF-IDF feature extraction, and training two models: Logistic Regression and Linear SVM. Both models achieved 90% accuracy on the test set, with strong performance for positive and negative sentiments, and slightly lower recall for neutral sentiment. We also saved the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer and created a reusable prediction function for real-time sentiment analysis.
